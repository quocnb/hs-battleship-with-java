<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Battleship (also called <em>Battleships</em> or <em>Sea Battle</em>) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. It started off as a pencil and paper game, until Milton Bradley coined the rules and published the game. Fun fact: it was one of the first games to be produced as a computer game in 1979! In this project, we will recreate this timeless classic.</p>
<p>First off, brush up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">rules of the game</a>. There are different variations of the Battleship game, but we will stick to the original rules written by Milton Bradley. You have a 10Ã—10 game field and five ships to arrange on that field. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but not diagonally across the grid spaces; the ships should not cross or touch each other. The goal is to sink all the ships of the opponent before your opponent does this to you.</p>
<p>Understanding how the ships will be fielded is exactly where we are going to start!</p>
<p>Before you start, let's discuss the conventions of the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a 10x10 field, the first row should contain numbers from 1 to 10 indicating the column, and the first column should contain letters from A to J indicating the row.</li>
<li>The symbol <code class="java">~</code> denotes the fog of war: the unknown area on the opponent's field and the yet untouched area on your field. </li>
<li>The symbol <code class="java">O</code> denotes a cell with your ship, <code class="java">X</code> denotes that the ship was hit, and <code class="java">M</code> signifies a miss.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>At this stage, you will put your first ship on the game field.</p>
<ol>
<li>Print an empty game field, according to game conventions.</li>
<li>To place a ship, enter two coordinates, the beginning and the end of the ship. The order of the coordinates (start to end or end to start) does not really matter.</li>
<li>In later stages we will need to know the length of the ship and the positions on the field on which it's parts are placed. Therefore output this information to a player. Here is an example of possible formatting: <code class="java">Length: 3</code> and <code class="java">Parts: F2 F3 F4</code></li>
<li>If an error occurs in the input coordinates (coordinates are not on the same line or out of bounds), your program should report it. The message should contain the word <code class="java">Error</code>. </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Enter the coordinates of the ship:
&gt; A1 A4
Length: 4
Parts: A1 A2 A3 A4</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">...
Enter the coordinates of the ship:
&gt; F7 F3
Length: 5
Parts: F7 F6 F5 F4 F3</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">...
Enter the coordinates of the ship:
&gt; G2 E3
Error!</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">...
Enter the coordinates of the ship:
&gt; A11 A14
Error!</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">...
Enter the coordinates of the ship:
&gt; L2 M2
Error!</code></pre>
